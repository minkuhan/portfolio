                    investment market, how might the bank provide new digital solutions for young 
                    Canadians to thrive in today’s challenging economy?”</b></p>
    
                    <p>In Canada’s current economy, young adults are constantly facing financial obstacles and 
                        challenges due to the high prices of housing and investments.  Our group wants to help 
                        them to become better off and work towards their financial goals. With the problem that 
                        Scotiabank gave us, we  conducted the initial research to learn about the common struggles
                         Young Canadians have with their finances.  </p>
    
                         <p><b>And we discovered these following facts:</b></p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
    
                <p>To further our exploration of the problem, we conducted the user interviews to get in-depth 
                    knowledge and understanding of our target user group. We spoke with young adults, ranging 
                    from 20 to 25 years old, to get their personal insights on the current financing and investing 
                    behaviors, habits, and goals. <br>
    
                    We discovered that many of them have aspirations like buying a house and owning their own place, 
                    but before they can do any of that, they need to pay their student debt first. We also found that 
                    they struggle with prioritizing their time & effort towards their finances. They understand that 
                    it’s important to make payments ASAP but often forget about them due to last minute due to their 
                    busy lives.</p>

                    Using the information collected from the researches and user interviews, we put together the 
                    affinity diagram, allowing us to visualize and discover the commonalities of our users’ 
                    experiences, opinions, ideas, struggles, and perspectives towards their investments and 
                    financial goals. <br>

                    It helped us to narrow down a problem statement that would guide our works and to start 
                    the ideation process in the right direction as well as  bringing the clarity and focus to
                    the design space.

                <p>Our group came up with different concepts to tackle the problem. One of our early concepts 
                    were an education platform that would teach financial education, however, this idea was 
                    questionable for our target demographic.  We discovered that the learning content through
                    quizzes and articles weren’t digestible.  They simply does not have enough time for this 
                    learning content.

                    In the later iteration process, our group decided to steer away from the trivial features, and focus on the aspects of tracking their debts and loans.</p>
